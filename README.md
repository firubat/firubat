I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow at the University of Helsinky, working with [Jouko Väänänen](http://www.math.helsinki.fi/logic/people/jouko.vaananen/) as part of the [Helsinki logic group](https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/Logic/Home). I'm interested in logic and set-theory, and in particular in the interactions between set-theory and various kinds of logics. My MSc and PhD theses were written in the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://mathematics.huji.ac.il/) under the supervision of  Menachem Magidor, the former on the topic of the Modal Logic of σ-centered forcing and the latter on the topic of Inner models from extended logics.
